## About Me

I'm a front-end dev focused on JavaScript, but I don't mind using other languages too.
I'm a leader who wants to take responsibility and deliver the best possible outcome, with the team's help.
I'm a coder aiming to improve code quality, frameworks, and how we develop things.
I'm a writer who enjoys sharing knowledge while learning from others.
